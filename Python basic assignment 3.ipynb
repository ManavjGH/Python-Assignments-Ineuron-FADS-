    "1.Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Using a function we can write a set of code once and use it again and again by just calling that function instade of writting the whole set of code again and again, in short functions makes our life easier. This is why functions are advantageous to have in our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The code in function runs when it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What statement creates a function?\n",
    "Ans: 'def function()' creates a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A function is a set of code which accepts generalised values for eg. function(a), and a function call is something which has a specific value for eg. function(1). Here a(a generalised value) is substituted with a specific value '1', SO a function call can only be used on an already specified function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Variables that are defined inside a function body have a local scope, and those defined outside have a global scope.There's only one global Python scope per program execution.Local scopes depends upon the person wruttung code or what a certain question or problem demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6.What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A local variable retains its value until the next time the function is called A local variable becomes undefined after the function call completes \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7.What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result (value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller. Yes, it is possible to have a resturn value in an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8.If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The function call returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9.How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Ans: We can use 'global' keyword b efor the variable in the  function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10.What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The data type of None is None type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11.What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: This sentence imports the give module if it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12.If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "Ans: spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13.What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "Ans: We can use exception handling in this case which will give the name of the  error instade of crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "14.What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "Ans: The try clause you test a block of code for errors. The except clause lets you handle the error.\n"
